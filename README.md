Angular 7 User Registration and Login Example with Angular CLI

Running the Angular CLI Version of the Tutorial Example Locally
This version of the example is pretty much the same as the Webpack version above, I've just copied it into the project structure generated by Angular CLI (7.0.4) to make it easier for anybody that's using Angular CLI.

For more information about the Angular CLI check out the official website at https://cli.angular.io/.
Create a folder in your directory (in the command prompt path eg: C:/USERS/ABC/NEWFOLDER)

1. Install NodeJS and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
2. Install Angular CLI by running npm install -g @angular/cli

3. Install all required npm packages by running npm install from the command line in the project root folder (where the package.json is located).
4. Start the application by running ng serve --open from the command line in the project root folder.
5. Your browser should automatically open at http://localhost:4200 with the demo Angular 7 login page displayed.
